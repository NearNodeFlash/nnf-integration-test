# Upgrade Tester

The `upgrade-gitops-maker.sh` and `upgrade-tester.sh` tools are used together to execute upgrades across a series of releases. The former populates a gitops repo with the NNF releases, and the latter installs those releases.

See [Upgrade Tester](https://nearnodeflash.github.io/dev/repo-guides/release-nnf-sw/upgrade-tester.md) in the NNF documentation for details.
